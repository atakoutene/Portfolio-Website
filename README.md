Hi, I'm Takou Aurelien, a solution-oriented computer science student with an inclination to building my erudition and discovering as much of the world as I can. With a passion for technology and software development, I strive to apply these predilections to the field to not only meet but exceed expectations and drive meaningful results in my field. I appreciate developing and contributing to solutions that can positively impact an organization and the people it serves. Furthermore, I'm committed to maintaining an ethical and diverse perspective, adhering to the applicable laws, regulations, and organizational values to keep, and preserving the privacy, integrity, and accessibility of an organization and its clients’ assets.

Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in VS Code and GitHub, I designed my own virtual portfolio to display my professional background.
